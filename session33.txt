the mongodb instance is created in the private subnet(that is database subnet)
here, we don't get the public ip address
If we don't have the public ip, how can we connect to the instance ?
There 2 ways to connect to it :

The first way is 
---> First connect to the any public instance
---> From the public instance you can connect to private (we called this as jump server)

The Second way is connecting to VPN (Mostly used in all companies is VPN )

What is VPN and how does it work ?
Let's say  you are working from your laptop in your home network and you are trying to connect to
the AWS VPC which has VPN configured, if you want to browse the internet from your laptop, you can sen the request 
from the VPC to the internet, The client does not the exact location of you. It only knows from where does the traffic comes (in this case it will be  of the VPC )

Demo
create a ec2 instance with name openvpn  --> ami --> devopspractice --> no keypair --> default vpc --> allow all from SG --> then create 

log onto that instance via supperputty as usual
take sudo access with 
commands
 --> sudo su -
---> curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angristan/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh
---> chmod +x openvpn-install.sh
---> ./openvpn-install.sh
---> give the public ip of the instance
---> IPv6 [Y/n]: name
---> Port choice[1-3]: 1
---> Protocol [1-2]: 2
---> DNS [1-12]: 11 [here your wish]
---> Enable compression? [y/n]: n 
---> Customize encryption settings? [y/n]: n 
click any key
Client Name: your wish [Example: ravikumar]
Select an option [1-2]: 1 [Passwoed less client] 

---> ls -l 
we will  a file wiht name ravikumar.ovpn [Copy the whole in to your local laptop from the instance ] save the file with same name ravikumar.ovpn and file type as All files
After this install openvpn client from the chrome in your laptop
Search for openvpn in local laptop and click on plus + symbol  upload the saved file.
